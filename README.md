# Neighborhood Model Schlaatz
This model was built as part of a cooperation of the Potsdam University of Applied Sciences (Fachhochschule Potsdam) with the municipal housing company of Potsdam (ProPotsdam GmbH) and served as a first field application of PaSyMo â€“ an approach for participatory systems modeling. The research focus was on residential mobility and population dynamics in the Schlaatz neighborhood of Potsdam, Germany, a late-GDR social housing district to be refurbished from 2020 to 2035. The co-designed interactive agent-based model includes various data sets for visualization and interactive exploration in scenario development and can be run in GAMA.
